# Introduction
firc is an IRC client library written in C\+\+.

# Goals
To create a library that is

-   Working (stable)
-   Flexible
-   Easy to understand
-   Easy to use
-   Easy to expand

And personally I would also like to

-   Learn more about open source.
-   Learn how to write portable code.

# Current status
Nothing has been released yet.
Using the library is not recommended yet as things might still
change dramatically. This may be frustrating. You are welcome
to try though.

## Name
The project does not have a very good name, firc is temporary.

## Current features

-   Connect to multiple servers/networks.
-   Anti-flood implemented with an outgoing message queue.
-   Event system (IRC messages, new connections, etc).
-   Cache/database that keeps track of channels and users.
-   Simple plugin manager.

## Todo

-   There is some work to be done on the network cache/database.
-   Open up the network interface some more.
-   Documentation.
-   Improve SConstruct to allow for some command line arguments.
-   Verify status of release build.

## Future features

-   Let worker threads handle eventdispatching.
-   DCC ?
-   Windows port.

## Contact
I would be happy to receive feedback (good or bad) and
suggestions. You can reach me by email.
