(Done)* Frontend should be able to receive events just like the plugins. Therefore it must be possible to register callbacks dynamically.
(Done)* Implement network database/channel registry
(WIP) * Add native functions to query about network database info
* Add handlers for more irc events than join and privmsg.
(Done) * Add functionality for unloading plugins (experimental; what happens if the plugin is executing code while it is unloaded..?)
* What happens if the plugin has registered a callback? Then that callback must be removed when the plugin is unloaded.
	- Simple answer: Introduce api functions to unregister callbacks too, and make the plugins responsible for cleaning up after themselves.
* Write a parser for the numeric reply 005 (RPL_BOUNCE acc to rfc, but seems to be used as RPL_ISUPPORT by all irc servers nowadays) and store info in cache
* Perhaps look over the network cache code and adjust it to be more like the rest of the project.

Finalize:
* Remove all memory leaks (valgrind..?)
* Maybe create separate doxygen configs to generate external and complete documentation.
* Look through documentation.

Done.
