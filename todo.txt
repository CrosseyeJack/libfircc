(Done)* Frontend should be able to receive events just like the plugins. Therefore it must be possible to register callbacks dynamically.
(Done)* Implement network database/channel registry
(Done) * Add native functions to query about network database info
(Done) * Add functionality for unloading plugins (experimental; what happens if the plugin is executing code while it is unloaded..?)
(Done) * What happens if the plugin has registered a callback? Then that callback must be removed when the plugin is unloaded.

(Done (actually decided not to use it, but it works great!))* Add worker threads and a task/job queue system for executing plugins (and maybe other stuff so make it flexible?).
* Plugin unloading: event handler list is changed while in use.
	* Entries for plugin being unloaded must be marked as unloaded but not removed.
	* Removal of the entry in the list must be done when an unloaded entry is encountered. Then the iteration can proceed from the correct index.
	*
	* When iterating through the list to create jobs (executing event handlers), the list is locked.
	* If a thread executing a plugin tries to unload another plugin, it will try to acquire the list mutex to remove entries associated with the plugin being unloaded. Then that thread will simply wait for the mutex.
	* That means there will be jobs created for executing the unloaded plugin! Prevent this by blabla. See paper note.

* Prevent multiple Plugin objects from being created using the same shared library handle.

* Introduce api functions to unregister callbacks too, and make the plugins responsible for cleaning up after themselves.

* Write a parser for the numeric reply 005 (RPL_BOUNCE acc to rfc, but seems to be used as RPL_ISUPPORT by all irc servers nowadays) and store info in cache

* Perhaps look over the network cache code and adjust it to be more like the rest of the project.

* Add handlers for more irc events than join and privmsg.

Finalize:
* Perhaps Johnny Bigert some includes, header cleanup
* Remove all memory leaks (valgrind..?)
* Find all "ETODO" notes and fix.
* Find all "iostream" and fix.
* Go through doxygen todo list.
* Maybe create separate doxygen configs to generate external and complete documentation.
* Look through documentation.
* Find and replace all Johnny Bigert references ^^

Misc:
* Look at/install trac?

Done.
