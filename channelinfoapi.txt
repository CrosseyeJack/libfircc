1. getChannelInfoBuffer(void **channelInfoBuffer/Session)
Desc: Allocates and generates a list of users and other channel info (topic..).
Then provides an API to work on that channelinfo, which will be fast.
Then a destroyer function.

Pros:
* Flexible (no limit on number of users or nickname lengths etc)
* Easy to use

Cons:
* User is responsible for freeing up memory with destroyer.
* The create function may take some time (memalloc(s) + O(n) copying)

2. Hashtables for looking up channels and users quickly at every call,
and no copying at all.

But how do you iterate over all users then (as the number of users may change while you are iterating..)?
