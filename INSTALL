SOFTWARE DEPENDENCIES

  libfircc can be built and used on both 32- and
  64bit systems.

  In order to use libfircc you need to have the
  following libraries installed:

  - libpcrecpp
  - libdl
  - libpthread

BUILDING AND INSTALLING ON LINUX

  CMake (www.cmake.org) is used to build and install
  libfircc. Install the latest version available.

  To build libfircc with CMake on a typical Linux
  distribution, follow these steps:

  1. Create a subdirectory within the main libfircc
     directory. You can call it "build". Navigate
     (cd) into this subdirectory.

  2. To build the lib, type:

     cmake .. # This should generate a makefile
     make # This should compile and link libfircc.

     This should generate libfircc.so and
     libanpcode.so .

  3. To install the lib (which might require root
     access), type:

     make install

     This should install the lib in (default)
     /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include .

  Refer to the CMake documentation for more
  details.

  Please report any build problems at
  https://github.com/antonp/libfircc/issues .
